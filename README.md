ASK (AMPLITUDE SHIFT KEY)
Wireless transmission can be done by using 433Mhz or 315MHz ASK RF Transmitter and Receiver modules. In these modules digital data is represented by different amplitudes of the carrier wave, hence this modulation is known as Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK).
3 stages of experimants:
1.Transmitter in water and receiver in air medium
2.Both transmitter and receiver in different buckets
3.Both transmitter and receiver in same Bucket
